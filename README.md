## [HAKE](http://hake-mvig.cn/home/)
**HAKE**[[website]](http://hake-mvig.cn/home/) is a new large-scale knowledge base and engine for human activity understanding. HAKE provides elaborate and abundant **body part state** labels for active human instances in a large scale of images and videos. With HAKE, we boost the action understanding performance on widely-used human activity benchmarks. Now we are still enlarging and enriching it, and looking forward to working with outstanding researchers around the world on its applications and further improvements.
